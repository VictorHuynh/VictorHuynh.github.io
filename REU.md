## ML Benchmarking Research

**Project description:** During my internship at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, I contributed to the development of an open-source machine learning performance benchmarking platform called DynaDojo. My role involved conducting in-depth literature reviews and translating mathematical measures of complexity into functional code. This code was used to evaluate various machine learning algorithms perfomance at modeling systems of varying complexity.
