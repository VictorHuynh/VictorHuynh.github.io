## 433MHz Ground Station

**Project description:** As a member of the satellites avionics subteam, I was put in charge of designing an RF interface board to connect our 433 MHz radio to a Raspberry Pi 4 for command and data handling purposes for our satellite. Furthermore, I incorporated relays and an H-bridge module to enable efficient switching between transmission and receiving modes.
