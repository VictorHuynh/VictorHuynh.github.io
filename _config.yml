  Electrical Engineering @ Stanford University
  <br><br>
  I’m a coterminal M.S. student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University with a passion for aerospace, communications, and applied machine learning. I thrive at the intersection of signal processing, embedded systems, and RF, and I enjoy building hardware–software systems that turn theory into practice. Looking ahead, I’m eager to apply my skills to advance technologies in space systems, communication networks, and intelligent hardware!
