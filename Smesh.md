## Smoke Detection Network

**Project description:** Currently, I am involved in prototyping a wildfire smoke detection network in collaboration with Stanfordâ€™s School of Sustainability. The goal of this project is to obtain data on environmental conditions near prescribed fires to improve forest management and community health goals, all at a low cost. My responsibilities vary from designing PCBs to interface smoke detectors with Raspberry Pi units to CADing and 3D printing enclosure cases for the electronics and sensors.
