## Electrical Ground Support Equipment

**Project description:** As Avionics Lead on the Rockets Team, I led a seven-member subteam responsible for designing and building electrical ground support equipment (EGSE) for rocket engine tests. In this role, I developed systems to support cold flow testing, including power distribution, data acquisition, and sensor interfacing. I also worked hands-on to build wiring and PCB assemblies, as well as create test protocols that enabled reliable propulsion hardware validation.
